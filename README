📡 MQTT IoT Demo
Go Publisher & Subscriber + Mosquitto + Node-RED
Overview
This project is a lightweight IoT messaging demo based on MQTT.
It shows how:
a Go application publishes IoT device data
Mosquitto acts as a message broker
multiple consumers (Go subscriber, Node-RED) can receive the same data
The system simulates an IoT bracelet sending telemetry such as heart rate.
Designed to be Node-RED friendly ✅
