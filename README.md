# 📡 MQTT IoT Demo

**Go Publisher & Subscriber + Mosquitto + Node-RED**

## Overview

This project is a lightweight IoT messaging demo using MQTT.  

It demonstrates how:

- A Go application publishes IoT device data  
- Mosquitto acts as a message broker  
- Multiple consumers (Go subscriber, Node-RED) can receive the same data  

The system simulates an IoT bracelet sending telemetry, such as heart rate.  

Designed to be Node-RED friendly ✅
